# vue-weather | A weather application

## What this app is about

I developed this app to familiarize with Vue.js, and I had quite some fun doing it. The app is now deployed at https://fervent-cray-8942f5.netlify.app/

## How it works

Search for a city to know what the weather is like there. Try searching for a cold and a warm city, the background will adapt to the temperature.
